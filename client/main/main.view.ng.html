  <h1>Welcome to timeShare!</h1>
  <p>Clinical research in a University setting is carried out by individual investigators, most of whom direct their own research team. Research team members may include nurses, medical assistants, advanced practice providers, physical therapists, dieticians, and many other specialties. Because clinical research projects are most often funded on a per-subject basis, and guarantees of duration of funding and available subjects are rare (the sponsors' main goal is rapid enrollment, which will decrease thier total cost, so enrollment is competitive, and some sites in a multi-site study will enroll more subjects while otehrs enroll fewer or even none),funding for research teams is still uneven and uncertain. Personnell costs require the greatest expenditure for most research  programs and in uncertain funding environments, investigators may feel compelled to go through cycles of hiring and laying-off skilled workers. SInce the expertise and experience of a research team is its greatest asset, this is a counterproductive strategy. A need exists to help research teams increase their staffing when needs temporraily increase and to reduce personnel costs during less active periods.</p>

<h2>So what did I do?</h2>
<p>In order to more efficeintly manage clinical research personnel needs and research team costs I have established a mechanism for identification and temporary transfer of responsibilty/funding for individuals with specific appropriate skills. My "market" is secure, easy to use and efficiently conveys all needed information for both ends.</p>

<h2>Why you?</h2>
<p>Teams with excess, underutilized staff time will have their personnel better utilized, and everyone's happier when they can do something useful. Furthermore, there will be decreased cost, as full salary support is provided by the "buyer".</p>

</div>
<div class = "col-md-4">
<h2>Win for everyone</h2>
<p>Investigators with temporary increases in personnel needs will be able to carry out their reasearch without the need to advertise, hire or, in many cases, train new team members. Overall costs will be lower because of the ability of the individuals to start work only when needed, and to hit the ground running.</p>
